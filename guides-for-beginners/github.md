**Core Git Concepts**

These core git concepts need to be understood thorough online resources :

Git
Local vs Remote Repositories
Clone
Commit
Branch
Merge
Pull/Push

Git can be used through several interfaces:

**Available Git Interfaces**

Option 1: Git CLI (Command Line Interface)

- Pros:\
    Works universally as Git's native language\
    Provides deep understanding of Git's inner workings

- Cons:\
    There is a learning curve if you are not used to the terminal (not beginner friendly)

Option 2: Github Desktop

- Pros:\
    Beginner-friendly, has a simple UI to visualize changes and commits.\
    Easy to set up and start pushing/pulling to GitHub.\

- Cons:
    May limit understanding of underlying Git commands


Option 3: VS Code's Integrated Git

- Pros:\
   Can see changes, commits, and branches inside the same editor 

- Cons:\
    Like GitHub Desktop, may hide Git's deeper mechanics



***Our Recommendation:***

Learn Git CLI (at least the minimal commands), to ensure you're not entirely dependent on a GUI. You should know whatâ€™s actually happening when you use GUI. And then you will be far more comfortable debugging Git issues in the future

basic commands:\
    git init / git clone\
    git status\
    git add\
    git commit -m "message"\
    git push / git pull\
    git checkout -b branch_name / git merge\
    branch_name\

- Mastering these basics is the key to understanding Git, even if we use a GUI later
- Then use Github Desktop/ Git panel in VS code.
- For quick commits and everyday tasks, the VS Code interface or GitHub Desktop can be more convenient.
- For more advanced operations (conflict resolution in certain edge cases, interactive rebase, or stashes), CLI might be more transparent.
